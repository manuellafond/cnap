PREREQUISITES:

You will need g++ from gcc installed on the machine. Furthermore you
will need a BLAS library. On some Linux distributions one such comes
pre-installed. On Ubuntu it can be aquired through the package
manager.

You will also need the program CMake, which is used for build
management.


COMPILATION:

Run:

  > cmake .
  > make

To confirm everything works as expected you can also run:

  > make test


RUNNING THE PROGRAMS:

After successful compilation you should have the binary file 'qdist'
in the src directory. To run the program, provide two text files with
trees described in the Newick format, e.g:

  > ./qdist testdata/small1.tree testdata/small2.tree


INSTALLATION:

To install your program into your bin directory you can run:

  > sudo make install
